Today cometh with some minor changes, mostly concerning the readability and mobile responsiveness.

- Hamburger menu has shining new animations! Icon transforms into a cross and back and navbar items have a little bit of sliding to them. Both animations are very clumsy, but, ehhh. I'll fix them later. 
- Blog text now has ident and padding to it. 
- Background now has dotted pattern. I just think it's neat!
- Blog page is being sorted by latest now. It will be probably reworked into a table, but still, it's a chunk of progress. 

Good going. I also added a 'projects' page yesterday, but didn't really add anything in it. Well, no biggie, it's gonna be filled out soon enough.

UPD: Now a hamburger icon has even better animation! Figured out a good way just before going to sleep.
