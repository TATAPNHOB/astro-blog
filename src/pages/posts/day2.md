Today cometh with some minor changes, mostly concerning the readability and mobile responsiveness.

- Hamburger menu has shining new animations! Icon transforms into a cross and back navbar items have a little bit of sliding to them. Both animations are very clumsy, but, ehhh. I'll fix them later. 
- Blog text now has ident and padding to it. 
- Background now has dotted pattern. I just think it's neat!
- Blog page is being sorted by latest now. It will be probably reworked into a table, but still a good chunk of progress.
