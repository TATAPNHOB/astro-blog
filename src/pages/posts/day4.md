Hey all! (or is it hey y'all?)

I didn't post yesterday because I was mostly busy. The work I do for now takes the time mostly during weekends and holidays. That and I didn't do much more with the website. Well, now there were some changes, mostly concerning CSS layout; minor tweaks here and there. The biggest thing is that I made everything more contrast-y, switched from `#112222` on the background to pure black, and got rid of orange red. Also some elements (and some texts) are now smaller.

I spent a whale of my time off during those two days surfing the 'net in the most real sense possible, visited some Neo Cities, and boy, did I see some inspiration. I saw a lot of websites that just did not care. Saw websites that care a lot. Saw ones that are made in Web 1.0 style, glitters, clip arts and pixelated banners included. Saw slick and stylish ones. And... I regret to inform you that I still love modern CSS and JS practices. I really love the feel of the old-school web, but it is really not my thing. More so, I kind of adore this cycle of work, where I make a feature and then troubleshoot and refactor it on mobile and other devices. To each their own Zen, I guess. 

This website is far from being modern and peak design, of course. In fact, it never was supposed to be; I chose a monospace font and flat-colored boxes and containers for a reason. This is a first step in a big **Journey to the Web** and I will be wise to remember it. Moreover, it was made without a coherent design in mind, wasn't painstakingly created as a mockup in Illustrator or Figma and is generally a product of the *mind flow*. And I am fine with that.

Anyway. I also mapped out the [Projects page](../../projects) today. This is ought to be a doozy. 

That would be all about my web affairs. I am really happy that I didn't burn out yet. Here's to the eternal feeling of webdev empowerment!
