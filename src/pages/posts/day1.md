Nice! I survived the emotional kick-back after loading the announcement in the Telegram channel and going for a (bad) night's sleep. Despite everything, I still like what I did and the response has been warm so far.

I did some small changes to my liking. 
- Moved cogs to the footer.
- Made footer stick to the bottom.
- Did a cool scrolling animation for the triangular brackets in the header.
- Now navigation list element stays highlighted when it is on its own page.
- Made a 'check the latest post' card for an index page! I prototyped it in Illustrator and then wrote it on CodePen for better flexibility. You can fiddle with it [here](https://codepen.io/tatapnhob/pen/ZEVvwMb) (it has a little hover animation). 
- Did a new favicon.
- A lot of undocumented refactoring and swooping stuff under the rug.

Also, I tried to connect Telegram's Instant View to my articles, but I guess it doesn't even work as intended anymore. No Instant View for me.

In other news, in some ungodly coincidence, the [ttphb.com](https://ttphb.com) website is going to be saved from our Chinese overlords on the 25th of September. Would be cool to snatch it, although it probably is on some kind of autopayment schedule. Yeah, I'm not too optimistic about it.

I won't submerge in Obisidan syncing just yet, I think. Still having fun with the native generation, and having no need to automatize the proccess. So, it will stay that way for now. I also thought that maybe I would like to write a Telegram bot that would fetch posts from my channel. I'll think about it some more. For now, I'm tidying up and adding other features.

The next blog post is probably gonna be a technical one also, but I'll try to branch out. I've got a draft of movies and TV series reviews that I've watched in a couple of weeks. 

And that's about it! See you on the flip side!
