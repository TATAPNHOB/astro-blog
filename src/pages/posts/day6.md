It's big design overhaul day! I tried to make everything lighter and smaller and... yeah, you tell me if I cracked the formula. I think it has that industrial *Half-Life/Deus Ex* look going on, albeit a more modern one. So, in more details:

- Background dots are now smaller and the background itself is slightly gradiented.
- Navigation bar is a bit more distinguished now. Title case, top margin, and new hover effects see to that.
- Most headings are now centered to left and have those '##' pseudo-elements. Just for fun. 
- Tags on the [blog page](../../blog) are now visible from the get-go. 
- Footer is transparent now, cogs have strokes, but everything still mixes nicely on mobile. 
- Some juicy navbar and heading animations! 

Suffice to say we're in the new age now. Or... *it's just the same page in a different age*.
