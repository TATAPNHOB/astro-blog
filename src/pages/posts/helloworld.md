Hey. So, I have this bad habit, right? I never complete stuff. I cannot physically finish anything without anyone else's presence. This hurts me in a personal and professional sense, and this is why I want to try something new: achieving the so-called **minimum viable product** first. I create the most basic thing and add features over it. This blog started as a tutorial on *Astro*, and then it was finished in my style. Hooray!

## What's next?

- Obsidian sync (all blog posts are just .md files, so this ought to be fairly easy)
- RSS feed connection
- Custom domain!
- CV section
- Portfolio section
- Recommendation section
- Cool animations and transitions
- Newsletter, maybe?
- 100 days of indie web?? Who am I, a web designer????

## What's even nexter?

In a more global scope, I don't quite know yet. I wanna make it like a game of evolution. The simplicity of this site is nice, but sooner or later I will stop lingering in this 'age' and try to refactor and add stuff on top. Guess in the end we will have **the best damn personal site ever**. 

(Or just a good one. I mean, monospace *is* the new black.)
